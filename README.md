In this paper, we present the "IoT Security Dataset", a domain-specific dataset of 7,147 samples focused solely on IoT security discussions. We further employed multiple transformer models to automatically detect security discussions. Through rigorous investigations, we found that IoT security discussions are different and more complex than traditional security discussions.
